## First Camel Route Example
This project shows a simple example of a route using Apache Camel and the Spring DSL. It has a restlet endpoint that asks for the price of a stock code. The route uses a simple content-based router that takes the stock code into account: if the stock code is NASDAQ or  DOWJONES it provides a hard coded price. Otherwise, it forwards the request to the google finance API and returns the current price to the caller.
